| **Transformers are worth your attention** | [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) | 2017 | <details><summary>read why</summary>The paper that started it all, introduction to the basic concept & comparison to previous methods like RNN. The transformer here has both encoder & decoder layers creating a seq2seq model</details> | Feldman | [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/kZvYM3MCuiYUSMEvmhizJe2qMYgcDXoauCzRIVc-6wAb1-D1voWsHykIXoYQoum0._4_HD8RGKeb2KX-O) (K%32MLKi) | [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qwbj3V7-GAnEJnsAHBFS4AG_k6bVQsP41VcaZObz1Kw/edit#slide=id.g1157f5f83be_0_279) |

In code!** | [The annotated transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) | 2017 | <details><summary>read why</summary>Going into depth into the various tricks used to make transformers work. Implementing a trnasformer without them would lead to poor results</details> | x | x | x |
| **Visualizing Attention** | [Visualizing Attention in Transformer-Based Language Representation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02679) [On the Relationship between Self-Attention and Convolutional Layers](https://github.com/epfml/attention-cnn)  | 2017 | <details><summary>read why</summary>Attention is useful for explainability too, we can see what the network is using for the task. In this lecture we will exammine visualizations of this in NLP & vision</details> | x | x | x |

| **GPT** | [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) | 2020 | <details><summary>read why</summary>This model from OpenAI used only decoders & achived state of the art text generation. Its authors first didn't release it becuase they said it is too dangerous. It is now the backbone of Github Co-Pilot</details> | x | x | x |
| **Wav2Vec U** | [Wav-to-vec U - Unsupervised Speech Recognition](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-unsupervised-speech-recognition-without-supervision/) | 2021 | <details><summary>read why</summary>this unsupervised model from Facebook, is able to learn language representations. we use the supervised version in our A2K input</details> | Feldman | [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/Dk9cf7-iXgCv13_FEBSSYMDc1ZWeEbaVAtLERa9-UPVAZjKKttn-6Rx9I-0G2Jj3.iXL0WXaHG4HIof5o) (p.qE+Q59) | [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1Zn2JETCpCcNDsSLsrMlVgsf8fNDJ35s50ymOzAA1d8U/edit) |
| **DETR for object detection & segmentations** | [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) | 2020 | <details><summary>read why</summary>Taking transformers even further to other CV tasks in this paper the autors from FacebookAI combine CNN with transformers to reduce some of the human prio needed in designing object detection & segmentation models</details> | Tal | [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/2EJyfh4SdomCLkHxBPFskQYZ1jKeX0gCvK5Fkqc2EgcYzseOVIlsIXKVSMwlZHSW.Q9fdGBPkOnA-39pi) (17K%NSf3) | [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/15MM4QR1-XTs--W3TZUPwE1gy3-dkqq_27gfAY-G0b8o/edit) |

The model uses CLIP embedding & diffusion models to generate images from a text description. Google DeepMind also came up with a competing model called Imagen that argues for superior quality</details> | Tal | zoom () | slides |
